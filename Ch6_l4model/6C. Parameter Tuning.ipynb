    "The full model we built in the previous chapter contained multiple sets of synaptic connections (_aka_ edge-types): recurrent connections and feedforward connections from the \"LGN\" and \"BKG\" populations of cells. In even larger models the types of connections can grow exponentially. However with the SONATA network format it is easy to only run a subset of the entire network, which can simplify the process of trying to optimize cell and synaptic model parameters for results we expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we want to optimize the **syn_weight** parameter that controls synaptic weights between cells. But only do so for the **LNG** --> **L4** feedforward connections. (Later we can do the same for BKG --> L4 and L4 --> L4 connections). To test and optimize the simulation for only the LGN --> L4 connections we just need to create a special configuration file that only contains the required nodes and edges. Here we copied an existing one, modified it as follows, and renamed it *config.simulation_pointnet.lgn_only.json*.\n",
