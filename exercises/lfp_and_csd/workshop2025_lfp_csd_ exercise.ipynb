    "### Calculating Local Field Potentials and Current Source Densities from biophysically detailed network simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to explore how to calculate and analyze Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and Current Source Density (CSD) from biophysically detailed neural network simulations. These analyses are critical tools for bridging computational models with experimental neurophysiology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation and Significance\n",
    "LFPs are among the most commonly recorded signals in neuroscience experiments, providing insight into the collective behavior of neural populations. They represent the extracellular potential generated by the summed electrical activity of many neurons, primarily reflecting synaptic currents and other transmembrane currents. Because the total transmembrane current in a point-neuron model is zero, LFPs can only be computed from biophysically detailed neuron models. In recent years, scientists have worked to develop methods (\"tricks\") to estimate LFPs from point-neuron models.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSD analysis transforms LFP measurements into estimates of the net transmembrane current sources and sinks, revealing where ionic currents enter and leave neurons. This provides more precise spatial localization of neural activity than raw LFP recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll compare how different synaptic distributions (basal vs. apical) affect the resulting LFPs and CSDs, providing insight into how measured field potentials reflect underlying neural circuit activity."

    "#### Exercise Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate and plot the LFPs and CSD evoked by a reduced L4 mouse V1 network model of 400 $\\mu m$ radius consisting of 3 distinct excitatory cell types and an inhibitory PV cell population (180 neurons in total). The network is designed to have a realistic distribution of synaptic connections and neuron types, including basal and apical dendritic synapses. This is a significantly simplified model derived from a more realistic setup to reduce computational time. The network will produce non-smooth LFPs and CSDs that appear simplistic compared to experimental data, unlike the full-scale mouse V1 model. We provide the already built network SONATA files (network*) for a network with basal and apical synapses [network_allsynapses](network_allsynapses), only basal synapses [network_basalsynapses](network_basalsynapses), and only apical synapses [network_apicalsynapses](network_apicalsynapses), respectively. Use `BioNet` to run the simulations of the three networks and compare the evoked LFPs and CSDs.\n",
