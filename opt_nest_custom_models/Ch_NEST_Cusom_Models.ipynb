    "PointNet utlizes the NEST simulator for running point-neuron simulations, which includes many different varieties and types of neuronal models the majority of which can readily used during simulation in BMTK. An very useful practice is to take an existing network model built on model of a cell and replace it with a different cell model that more closely fits the needs of our research. With BMTK and SONATA this can be easily done, often without any programming, and even done on the fly before any given simulation.\n",

To define what model will be used with a specific subset of cells and their properties, SONATA has two defined reserved attributes `model_template` and `dynamics_params` which we will take advantage of in this example."
