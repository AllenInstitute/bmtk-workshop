    "Build a cortical column of 400 $\\mu m$ radius consisting of L1 inhibitory population (Htr3a) and L2/3-L6 excitatory and inhibitory populations of PV, SST, and Htr3a cells. Use the `NetworkBuilder` to create a network with 80% excitatory and 20% inhibitory neurons (up to 100 neurons total), and use `BioNet` to run the simulations. Record the extracellular potentials / local field potentials (LFPs) evoked by these neurons with a linear probe located at the center of the cortical column with 100 $\\mu m$ inter-electrode distance and plot the results. Calculate the CSD from the LFPs and plot it as well. Use the `VND` to visualize the network and check synaptic connections. Evaluate the effect of basal and apical dendritic synapses on the LFP and CSD by removing them from the model and simulating the network responses when only one of them is included."
