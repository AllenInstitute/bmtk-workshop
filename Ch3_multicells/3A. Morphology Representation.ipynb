    "# Understanding Morphology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will explain how BMTK and SONATA represent and understand the morphology of multi-compartment neuron, especially as it relates to the location of individual synapses. SONATA utilizes existing formats like NeuroML and SWC formats, so for most users they just need to download existing morphologies from databases like ModelDB or the Allen Cell-Types Database, and BMTK will recognize how to load and instantiate the downloaded files accordingly, without any extra thought from the user. But at times it may be necessary to understand what is going on at a deeper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are running simulations of thousands, or even millions, of morphologically realistic neurons trying to control and determine the location of each individual synapse would be impractical. By default BMTK allows users to write simple rules for each type of connection, such as\n",
    "* Pyramidal cells have most of their synapses far away from the soma\n",
    "* interneuron-to-interneuron connections may synapse at the soma, axon or basal dendrites\n",
    "\n",
    "BMTK will then build the connections accordingly. But to help users better understand what is going on under the hood, we have put together this mini-tutorial."

    "\n",
    "![](../images/neuron_cartoon_legend.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to represent the morphology is through the **swc** format. An \\*.swc file is a simple text file to represent the morphology using a space-delimited table. The morphology of all possible components of the neuron (including location of soma, axon, and all dendritic branches) is represented using a tree-like structure. Each line (except for the ones starting with a **#** which are used for comments) represents a point on the neuron. And each line also has a parent point (except for the root, often the soma, which has no parent).\n",

Cell-type morphology is likely to remain static (or alter only slightly) from simulation-to-simulation, but we may more frequently want to adjust the location and density of synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the synapses within an swc file are instead stored in the SONATA edges files using the reserved keywords **afferent_swc_id** and **afferent_swc_pos** (there are also reserved keywords for **efferent**/source-neuron synaptic position - but in most cases we don't use the **efferent** synaptic location since it usually comes from the axon).\n",

    "* **afferent_swc_id** - An integer value that corresponds to the closest **id** in the swc file\n",

According to the \"afferent_swc_id\" for the first \\#72 --> \\#0 connection, the location of the synapse is at id 1691, half way (afferent_swc_pos=0.5) between swc point 1691 and its parent 1690.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because NEURON is more concerned about the flow of ions between compartments, and into and out of the membrane, the precise morphology and positions of any dendritic/axon branch is not required. In the stylized representation, when the morphology is loaded into NEURON it will divide the cell into distinct **sections**, which represents a non-bifurcating column of a particular diameter and length. Each section is assigned a unique id inside the NEURON code, as well as a more readable name. Each section may in turn contain one or more **segments**, which act as individual computational units.\n",
