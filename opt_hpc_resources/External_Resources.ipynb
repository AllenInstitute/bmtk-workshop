    "# External Resources for Large-Scale Network Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Building, simulating, and analyzing large-scale network models can often be a resource intensive process. Although BMTK can often run simple-to-moderate network models using commercially available hardware - many scientists will find themselves quickly requiring access to High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources when the computational, memory, and/or storage requirements become greater than even the best modern laptops and desktops. When this happens you will have to rely on the resources of your institution's computing facilities or even on the Cloud Computing Platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond access to more powerful computing and memory resources, there are other benefits to using Cloud and HPC resources in your workflow! Using a shared environment can improve collaboration and replication, reducing the headaches and pitfalls when every one has to install the software requirements on their own machines.\n",

    "In this tutorial we provide a list of tools and resources that neuroscientists can take advantage of."

    "[The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG)](http://www.nsgportal.org/) is an NSF funded project that provides HPC resouces for neuroscienists. It provides access to extensive CPU, GPU, and Memory resources that may not always be available locally. But just as important, NSG includes a wide variety of pre-installed computational neuroscience software that can be used for everything from modeling, data analysis, and even AI and ML applications. For modeling and simulation not only does NSG include BMTK, but also other popular tools like NEURON, NEST, Brian, PyNN, NetPyNE, among others. See [https://nsgprod.sdsc.edu:8443/portal2/tools.action](https://nsgprod.sdsc.edu:8443/portal2/tools.action) for a list of available software.\n",
