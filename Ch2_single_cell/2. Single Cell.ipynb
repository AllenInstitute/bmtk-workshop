    "## Simulation with Synaptic Stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Stimulation with current clamp can provide useful information on the core electrophysiological profile of cells. However, if we are going to fit our cells into a large connected network we will want to show how the cell behaves when more realistic synaptic inputs are given to the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to drive a cell, or network, with synaptic stimulation is to use \"virtual\" type cells. Virtual cells do not have any electrophysiological or morphological properties, and are essentially just placeholders for spike-trains or currents. However, they can create feed-forward synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, we can add virtual cells to our model and simulation without having to rebuild the network. BMTK and SONATA allows for different populations of a network to be built independently and connected together in the config. So to add synaptic stimuli using virtual cells we will do the following:\n",
    "1. Create a new network of virtual cells that synapse onto our existing Scnn1a model.\n",
    "2. Generate spikes for our virtual cells.\n",
    "3. Update the configuration files.\n",
    "4. Rerun the simulation.\n",

    "### Creating the network\n",
    "\n",
    "As before we will use the network builder to create a new population of cells we will call \"virt_exc\". We will create 20 different \"virt_exc\" type cells by using the ```N=20``` option. \n",
    "\n",
    "And unlike biophysically detailed cells we don't need to specify dynamics_params, model_template, model_processing or morphology. All we need to do is specify that ```model_type='virtual'```."

By indicating virt_exc.nodes() we are saying that the source/pre-synaptic neurons for these types of edges are all \"virt_exc\" nodes. Similarly scnn1a.nodes() indicates we want to use all (i.e., the only) neuron in the scnn1a network. \n",

For example we could explicitly state we want only to connect to excitatory L4 neurons by setting ```target=scnn1a.nodes(ei_type='exc', layer='L4')```. Of course with only one cell-type in our population it will still produce the same results.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* __connection_rule__ is used to indicate the number of connections between each neuron in our source and target subsets. By passing in ```connection_rule=12``` we are telling the Builder that every source cells has 12 individual synapses onto every target cell. Later we will show how to pass in customized functions or lists to fine tune the rules of connectivity.\n",

The location of synaptic dynamics param files are set using the \"synaptic_models_dir\" option in the config file. \n",

    "\n",
    "SONATA spike files are an hdf5-based format for storing the action-potentials/spike times of cells within a network. We can use a tool like [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/) or [ViTables](https://vitables.org/) to open up the hdf5 file and see the overview:\n",

    "\n",
    "* SONATA files with spike trains will start with path /spikes/$<$population$>$/, where $<$population$>$ is the name of a population of nodes (i.e., cells). There may be more than one population in the spikes. \n",
    "* Then we have tables **node_ids** and **timestamps**, both having the same number of entries, and each row indicates a time (by default in ms from start) at which a specific node generated an action-potential.\n",
    "* The spikes and nodes may or may not be sorted. There is an optional attribute \"sorting\" which developers can use to determine if the spikes are unsorted (sorting=none), sorted by node_ids (sorting=by_id) or by time (sorting=by_time).\n",
